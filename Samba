Samba is an open source implementation of the Server Message Block/Common Internet File System (SMB/CIFS) protocol suite
Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of 
DOS and Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others

 install Samba Server :- sudo apt-get -y install samba
     
     make a samba_shared directory in /home/system  

Then w make few txt files in /home/system/samba_shared 
    touch a.txt b.txt c.txt
    
    cd /etc/samba
   ls /etc/samba
   
   backup of smb.conf 
    cp smb.conf smb.conf_bkp 
    
   do few configuration in /etc/smb.conf
      sudo nano smb.conf
     
 delete all the things inside smb.conf and then write:

    [samba_shared]
	comment = Welcome to samba
	path = /home/system/samba_shared
	browseable = yes
	read only = yes
	guest ok = no
  
  smbclient if not there then the command is:
    sudo apt-get -y install smbclient
    
    
start/stop services of both smbd and nmbd
   sudo systemctl start smbd
   sudo systemctl stop nmbd
   
   2nd part:
   whoami
   sudo pdbedit -a -u $(whoami)
   sudo pdbedit -L (to check all users)
   sudo ufw allow from (your ip addr) any app Samba
   e.g;sudo ufw allow from 192.168.254.130/24 to any app Samba
   sudo ufw reload  
   sudo smbclient -U <username> -L  //your ip
   e.g;sudo smbcllient -U system -L  //192.168.254.130
   
   
   restart both smbd and nmbd services:
     sudo systemctl restart smbd
     sudo systemctl restart nmbd

check their status 
    sudo systemctl status smbd
    sudo systemctl status nmbd
